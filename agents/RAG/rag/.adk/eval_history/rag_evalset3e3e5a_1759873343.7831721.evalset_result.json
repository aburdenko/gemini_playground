I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny\\r\\nlittle thing!\u201d\\r\\nIt did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her\\r\\nhead pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the\\r\\nbottle, saying to herself \u201cThat\u2019s quite enough\u2014I hope I shan\u2019t grow any more\u2014As it is, I can\u2019t get out at the\\r\\ndoor\u2014I do wish I hadn\u2019t drunk quite so much!\u201d\\r\\nAlas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the\\r\\nfloor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow\\r\\nagainst the door, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and, as a last resource, she\\r\\nput one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself \u201cNow I can do no more,\\r\\nwhatever happens. What will become of me?\u201d\\r\\nLuckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she grew no larger: still it was very\\r\\nuncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder\\r\\nshe felt unhappy.\\r\\n\u201cIt was much pleasanter at home,\u201d thought poor Alice, \u201cwhen one wasn\u2019t always growing larger and smaller,\\r\\nand being ordered about by mice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn\u2019t gone down that rabbit-hole\u2014and yet\u2014and\\r\\nyet\u2014it\u2019s rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me!
