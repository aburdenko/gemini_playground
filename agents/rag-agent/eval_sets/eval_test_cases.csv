She frequently questions ""Who in the world am I?"" and expresses that she is ""not myself,"" struggling to reconcile her perception of herself with the constant changes in her size and surroundings. This leads to confusion and difficulty explaining herself to others.

Furthermore, Alice exhibits considerable internal conflict and self-reprimand, often scolding herself severely and even wishing to ""box her own ears"" for perceived wrongdoings. She also experiences intense emotional shifts, crying ""gallons of tears"" and then abruptly stopping, indicating a struggle to manage her feelings. She expects ""nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,"" which suggests a disconnect from typical reality and an unusual expectation of her environment.",,simple,

She observed that the inhabitants, particularly during the croquet game, did not play fairly, quarreled dreadfully, and lacked clear rules. She also found it confusing that many things were alive. Despite wishing she hadn't come to Wonderland at times, she also found the ""sort of life"" there to be ""rather curious."" She was wary of the Queen and even felt a need to escape.",,simple,
