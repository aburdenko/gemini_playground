The treasurer took a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who\\r\\ninformed him that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person; and the court scandal ran for some time,\\r\\nthat she once came privately to my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without\\r\\nany grounds, further than that her grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and\\r\\nfriendship.
