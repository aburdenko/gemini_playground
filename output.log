I almost think I can\r\nremember feeling a little different. But if I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,\r\nthat’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\r\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.","title":"AliceInWonderland.pdf","uri":"gs://rag-engine-eval-service/AliceInWonderland.pdf"}},{"retrievedContext":{"ragChunk":{"pageSpan":{"firstPage":1,"lastPage":51},"text":"when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back\r\nto the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and\r\nshe tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself\r\nout with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice to herself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this\r\nminute!” She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she\r\nscolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears\r\nfor having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very\r\nfond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s no use now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people!\r\nWhy, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!”\r\nSoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small\r\ncake, on which the words “EAT ME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eat it,” said Alice, “and if it\r\nmakes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either\r\nway I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”\r\nShe ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way?
